## Calculator project for The Odin Project.

In this project I wanted to incorporate and practice as many Javascript specific tools as possible. I used ternary operators, array methods such as map(), switch statements, arrow functions, and DOM manipulation.
I also got to practice my flexbox skills and CSS. 

## Pitfalls and Difficulty
My biggest difficulty was early on in the project. It took me a while to create the logic for the special cases in a way that didn't require too much duplicate code but also retained clarity. In the end, I decided to use switch statements that targeted
the button's HTML class attribute and encapsulated the special cases in their specific switch statement cases. 

## Future improvements
I would like to make it so the prevDisplayed gave live feedback of the user's input. Right now, it only displays after a successful operation.
